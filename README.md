This repository contains code to combine tif files generated with the Thorlabs Kiralux Camera. The repository contains two files:

1. R script to combine files with the same prefix.
2. ImageJ macro to concatenate all the files within one directory and the nested subdirectories.

These scripts assume that all the files from one experiments are recorded in a single directory and that you need to automatically i) create separated subdirectories for each recording and ii) merge the files from each recording.
